mass.total_mass,Very High,MINIMIZE,Direct inverse relationship (a = F/m) means 10% lighter = 10% faster acceleration affects all forces
mass.cg_x,Very High,OPTIMIZE,Controls load distribution; rearward = more rear grip for RWD but too rearward loses front steering
mass.cg_z,Very High,MINIMIZE,Directly in load transfer formula; lower = less pitch/lift keeps front wheels planted during acceleration
mass.wheelbase,Low,MINIMIZE,Longer wheelbase slightly reduces load transfer (small effect) primarily affects handling not acceleration

aerodynamics.cda,Low,MINIMIZE,Drag grows with v² but at low speeds (0-15 m/s) drag is only 1-5% of drive force
aerodynamics.cl_front,Low,MAXIMIZE,Adds front normal force but front wheels not driven (less critical) minimal at low speeds (v² relationship)
